# Apache Httpd

## Description
The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related documentation. This project is part of the Apache Software Foundation. In addition, hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the project. This file is intended to briefly describe the history of the Apache HTTP Server and recognize the many contributors.

Apache HTTP Server is based on [NCSA HTTPd] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_HTTPd "NCSA HTTPd"). Apche HTTPd has played the most important of roles in the growth of [WWW (World Wide Web)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "WWW (World Wide Web)"). Apache has achieved the milestone of serving more than 100 million Websites in the year 2009. They are the first platform to reach such a milestone in aspect of WWW development.

### Number of downloads over time

**Apache Web Server** has dominated its competitor from the very beginning. According to the [Netcraft May 2015 Web Survey] (http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/05/19/may-2015-web-server-survey.html#more-19227 "Netcraft May 2015 Web Survey") which was ran on 857,927,160 sites and 5,281,889 computers, Apache held 39.25% Market share of all sites. The survey also revealed Apache holding 50.91% Market share of active sites, 49.19% Market share of the top million busiest sites and 46.95% Market share of computers.

## Features

Apache is certainly the oldest in the business out there. Each version comes with unique enhancements. In v2.4 multiple MPMs could be built as loadable modules. This is expected to enhance the runtime. Besides, the [Event MPM] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html "Event MPM") which was experimental in v2.2 is fully supported in v2.4

[If] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#if "<If>"), [Else] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#else "<Else>") and [ElseIf] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#elseif "<ElseIf>") have been added in Per-request configuration sections to configure better on per-request criteria. No matter what people say but nobody can deny that Apache Web Server is the oldest platform among its competitor. And it outnumbers its competitor on the basis of user number.

Each up gradation came up with its unique features which can simply distinguish between the features of its competitors. The following links are the official documentation of features which were added during the up gradations from on version to another:

**Documentation of new features in Apache 2.0:** http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/new_features_2_0.html

**Documentation of new features in Apache 2.2:** http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/new_features_2_2.html

## Major plugins

Plugins are usually extensions which enables a particular platform to do more. "Modules" could also be used as a synonymous term of plugin. Some of the popular modules for Apache are:

**mod_proxy_msrpc:** This module enables the anywhere Outlook service. Without it, Apache would block any Outlook Anywhere requests. Detailed information on this module could be found here: https://github.com/bombadil/mod_proxy_msrpc

All the details could be foud here: http://www.ip2location.com/developers/apache

**mod_amf:** This module for Apache is very popular for detecting mobile devices. The process is easy and fast. Details about this module could be found on this link: http://www.apachemobilefilter.org/

**mod_pLua:** The **mod_pLua** module is also among the popular modules. And it helps develope web applications. Details could be found on this link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/modplua/
