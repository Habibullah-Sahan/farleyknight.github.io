# Apache Httpd

## Description
The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related documentation. This project is part of the Apache Software Foundation. In addition, hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the project. This file is intended to briefly describe the history of the Apache HTTP Server and recognize the many contributors.

## Features

Apache is certainly the oldest in the business out there. Each version comes with unique enhancements. In v2.4 multiple MPMs could be built as loadable modules. This is expected to enhance the runtime. Besides, the [Event MPM] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html "Event MPM") which was experimental in v2.2 is fully supported in v2.4

[If] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#if "<If>"), [Else] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#else "<Else>") and [ElseIf] (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#elseif "<ElseIf>") have been added in Per-request configuration sections to configure better on per-request criteria. No matter what people say but nobody can deny that Apache Web Server is the oldest platform among its competitor. And it outnumbers its competitor on the basis of user number.

Each up gradation came up with its unique features which can simply distinguish between the features of its competitors. The following links are the official documentation of features which were added during the up gradations from on version to another:
