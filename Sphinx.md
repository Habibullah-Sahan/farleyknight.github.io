## Description

This should be a general description of the product. No more than a paragraph. It's best to quote someone else on this topic than write it by hand. In the future this policy might change, but I don't want the site to have too much custom language at this point.

## Analytics

### Google Trends

Google trends can be found [here](http://google.com/trends) but remember that the values are relative and don't give an indication of the volume of traffic, only a relative comparison by key word. Also the embed code does not show up on GitHub.

### Number of downloads over time

This figure may be reported by the organization or company which produced the software. If third-party information is available, that's even better and should be used over the previous case.

## Major versions

This should be a list of the last 3 to 5 major versions of the software, with links to download. Also, whenever possible, link to tags on GitHub to specific major versions, so programmers can start reading the code before making a "purchasing" decision.

## Security exploits

A list of all known CVE issues for the product, as well as security enhancements, grouped by major version. The list below is a rough example, and will probably need to be cleaned up in the future.

  - Fixed SSL bug 
* v0.9
